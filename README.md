# SolutionTransformer
This repository contains code and resources for application of transformers in mixture property prediction.

## Folders
1. `src`:  contains the python functions for training models. You'll find scripts, modules, and packages here that are used to implement the algorithms and methods involved in the work.

2. `data`: store any necessary data files required for training models. This could include datasets, preprocessed data, or any other data-related resources.
3. `notebooks`: contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase the step-by-step process of using functions in `src`. These notebooks are meant to provide interactive examples, tutorials, and documentation for using the code in the `src` folder.
4. `models`: save trained models and model weights. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `src` folder to understand the codebase and algorithms.
3. Check out the `notebooks` folder for interactive examples and tutorials.
4. If you're using machine learning models, the `models` folder is where you can save and load trained models.
5. If you have any datasets or data resources, place them in the `data` folder.

Feel free to contribute, open issues, or submit pull requests if you have any improvements or ideas to share. Happy pretraining!
